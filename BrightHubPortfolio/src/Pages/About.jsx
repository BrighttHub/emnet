            I’m Emnet Befkadu, a dedicated full stack developer with a strong foundation in both
            frontend and backend technologies. I build responsive and dynamic applications using HTML, CSS, 
            JavaScript, and React on the frontend, and Java, PHP, and MySQL on the backend. My passion for 
            development has driven me to constantly learn and build real-world projects, both independently 
            and in team settings. I’ve also taken part in tech communities like GDG, where I enhanced my skills
            and participated in a hackathon where my team placed second. Through these experiences, I’ve grown 
            not only as a developer but also as a collaborator who values teamwork, problem-solving, and delivering
            high-quality solutions.
